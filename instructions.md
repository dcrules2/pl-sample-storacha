DevRel Technical Task 
Many customers want to put their existing websites on web3.storage. 
1. Write a JavaScript example that demonstrates how to migrate the front page of the HTTPS Status Cats website (https://http.cat) to W3UP. 
You should produce javascript that: 
● Downloads front page html source code 
● Scans the html for cat images and downloads them (BONUS: download css as well to maintain the page style) 
● Uploads all the contents to W3UP 
● Returns a URL where the user can access the cat page from W3UP. 
Note: 
● Consider the implications of uploading all the files in a single upload as a directory versus triggering separate uploads for each file. 
● You have all of NPM at your disposal — feel free to use libraries to find image links in the downloaded HTML 
Results: 
● Post your response in a github repository and share with us 
● Partial credit (i.e. if you are able to accomplish some tasks but can’t get a fully visible page on w3up) is still worth submitting 
● Write a short blog on how to do that (you can use placeholders for screenshots to simplify this) or other forms that you are comfortable with (video, etc.) 
● Timebox to 1 day, please submit results as soon as you have completed the task
